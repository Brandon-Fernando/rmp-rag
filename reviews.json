                "Professor Chung is amazing! I loved having her for GWSS 200 so I had to take her other course. There are weekly discussions and lectures. In-Class days are mandatory for discussion. There is 1 group project. She breaks down terms and really wants everyone to dive deep into the work."

Professor had no clue how to teach. She just left us to get our hands dirty and then would say our ceramics were too small or not symmetrical enough. NOT VART 230! VART 141",

                "I loved getting to take a class with Lisa! She's funny and super chill. She also showed us a lot of really neat 21st century artists that we could get inspo from for our own 3D design projects. Gives creative freedom and solid feedback."

Her grading style can be a bit frustrating considering her instructions are never clear, I was marked for grammar but a lot of her instructions are grammatically inaccurate, ironically. overall easy class but if you feel confused email her for clarity or she will mark you.",
                "I took her Statistics for Social Sciences class. She's a delightful person but her teaching style just doesn't work for me. She's very disorganized and would often say things about the material that were just incorrect. The class was pretty easy but I think I would've learned a lot more with a different professor.",
                "Great teacher, enjoy her class, would take more classes with her. Our class walked to the campus labyrinth one day instead of doing our class work and we enjoyed the outside instead and learned about the labyrinth.",
                "Is unclear with directions, but the class was very interesting. Very nice teacher. Make sure you have good notes for the test because she tests you on class presentations. Overall very easy class bc minimum work but the assignments are worth a lot.",
                "I took her during the summer. The class is easy and not too many assignments. The only thing I could say is that she doesn't respond, you won't hear from her throughout the semester. Also she doesn't grade anything till last minute. So you wont know your grade until grades are final which is crazy. The work is based on quizzes to be honest.",
                "I took SYG2000 in the Spring semester, she is so cool, knowledgeable, and wants to make classes a little bit different than the others, she implements cool features besides the regular zoom ones. She was very flexible with dates as long as you let her know with anticipation. Great class, great discussions !!"
